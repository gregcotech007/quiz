# QuizMaster - A multiple-choice quiz game made in Python

[View the Live Project here - QuizMaster](https://p3-mc-quiz.herokuapp.com/)

The game "QuizMaster" is an online interactive game that provides a list of questions to the player and provides
3 multiple-choice answers to choose from. The player is asked to input a, b, or c. Once they hit the return key,
their answer is submitted and checked against the correct answer. If answer is correct, their score is incremented
by 1 and the running total score is presented to the player with a message saying the answer is correct.
If the user gets the question incorrect, their score does not change and the player is presented with their running
score and a message that they got the question incorrect.
Once the player has attempted all questions, they will then be presented with a final score. It is broken down into 
3 results:
    - less than or equal to 5 = "Better luck next time." with total score provided.
    - less thank or equal to 15 = "Great answers" with total score provided.
    - greater than 15 = "Congratulations Quizmaster!" with total score provided.

The player is then offered the option to play again by entering y/Y for Yes or n/N for No.
If the player selects 'y', the quiz game starts again.
If the player selects 'n', the player is presented with a message saying "Thank you for playing, come back soon!".
